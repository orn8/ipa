# orn8's iPA Repo

This is an iPA repo for a collection of interesting apps I've found. </br>
Please keep in mind that I have not made any of the apps featured in the repo, others have made them. </br>
If you like this project, please star this repo. It would mean the world to me. </br>
###### This repo only currently supports TrollApps. AltStore and Scarlet support is planned.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Pages Site](https://orn8.github.io/ipa).
2. Click "*Add repo to* [*your signing service*]".
3. Search for "[*the app you desire*]" and install it.
4. You might get an error saying "*An unknown error occured while installing this app.*" in TrollApps. This false-positive and you can ignore it.
