# orn8's iPA Repo

This is an iPA repo for a collection of interesting apps I've found. </br>
Please keep in mind that I have not made any of the apps featured in the repo, others have made them. </br>
If you like this project, please star this repo. It would mean the world to me. </br>
###### This repo only currently supports TrollApps. AltStore and Scarlet support is planned.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Pages Site](https://orn8.github.io/ipa).
2. Click "*Add repo to* [*your signing service*]".
3. Search for "[*the app you desire*]" and install it.
4. You might get an error saying "*An unknown error occured while installing this app.*" when installing some apps in TrollApps. This is a false-positive and can be ignored. Click [here](https://github.com/orn8/ipa/issues/1) to learn more.
###### The source code for the [Pages Site](https://orn8.github.io/ipa) and all iPA repo files are in the [pages](https://github.com/orn8/ipa/tree/pages) branch.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the iPA repo, please report an issue asking to add the app with its source. </br>
If you know what you're doing, you can also fork the repo, add the app to iPA repo, then create a pull request. </br>
I'll happily merge any pull requests that would make a nice addition.
